## Overview

This Flutter project demonstrates how to add 3D vehicle models on top of Google Maps, creating an interactive and visually appealing map experience similar to ride-sharing apps like Uber. The project uses pre-rendered 3D models and real-time coordinate conversion to achieve smooth animations and rotations of vehicles on the map.

## Features

- Integration with Google Maps in Flutter
- Custom 3D vehicle markers using pre-rendered images
- Smooth animation of vehicle position and rotation
- Real-time conversion of geographic coordinates to screen coordinates
- Multiple vehicle support with independent movements
- Optimized performance for mobile devices

## Prerequisites

- Google Maps API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter_google_maps_3d_pins.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd flutter_google_maps_3d_pins```

3. Install dependencies:

```flutter pub get```

4. Add your Google Maps API key:
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key

5. Run the app:

```flutter run```

## Project Structure

- `lib/main.dart`: Entry point of the application
- `lib/map_with_overlay.dart`: Main widget for Google Maps integration and 3D vehicle rendering
- `lib/car_marker_widget.dart`: Widget for rendering the 3D vehicle marker
- `lib/route.dart`: Classes for handling route data
- `lib/data/notifier.dart`: State management for vehicle positions and rotations

## How It Works

1. **3D Model Preparation**: We use pre-rendered images of a 3D vehicle model from 60 different angles.

2. **Google Maps Integration**: The app uses the Google Maps Flutter plugin to display the map.

3. **Coordinate Conversion**: Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) are converted to screen coordinates in real-time.

4. **Animation**: Vehicle markers are animated using Flutter's animation system for smooth movement and rotation.

5. **State Management**: The app uses Riverpod for efficient state management of vehicle positions and rotations.

## Customization

- To use a different 3D model, replace the images in the `assets/images/truck/` directory.
- Adjust the number of pre-rendered images by modifying the `imageCount` constant in `car_marker_widget.dart`.
- Customize vehicle movement patterns by modifying the `updateRoute` method in `data/notifier.dart`.
